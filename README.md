# Handwritten Digit Recognition  

This project is a web-based handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Users can draw a digit (0-9) on a canvas, and the model predicts the digit in real-time with **high accuracy, even for complex and hard-to-read handwritten digits.**

## Project Overview  
This project uses a trained CNN model on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. The frontend provides an interactive canvas for drawing digits, while the backend processes the image and returns a prediction.
